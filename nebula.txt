A nebula (Latin for 'cloud' or 'fog';[2] pl. nebulae or nebulæ 
– nebulas is not proper and a colloquialism at best [3]) 
is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases. 
Originally, the term was used to describe any diffuse astronomical object, 
including galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, 
was once referred to as the Andromeda Nebula 
(and spiral galaxies in general as "spiral nebulae") before the true nature of 
galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others.
