Spectre

The HP Spectre line of Ultrabooks and 2-in-1 laptops has always consisted of extraordinarily attractive devices. 
So, when we say that the 2019 Spectre x360 takes things to another level, that should mean something. 
This is one of the most beautiful laptops on the market right now, with its gem cut design and sleek profile. 
Couple that with the powerful Intel Whiskey Lake processors and long battery life, 
and you get one of the best laptops on the market right now. 
Its ability to flip into a Windows tablet is just icing on the cake.
